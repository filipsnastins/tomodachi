# Contributing

## Instructions for contributors

Please help out to add features in the library that are missing or
prepare pull requests with solutions to any bug you may encounter during
execution.

If you're already using `poetry` ([poetry @
pypi](https://pypi.org/project/poetry/)), then please do so since it's
the preferred way of handling the dependencies of this library. `poetry`
can also be configured to handle virtualenvs automatically.

### Clone the repo and install the required dependencies

```bash
local ~/code$ git clone git@github.com:kalaspuff/tomodachi
local ~/code$ cd tomodachi

# Using poetry
local ~/code/tomodachi$ poetry install -E uvloop -E protobuf -E aiodns -E opentelemetry

# or alternatively with pip
local ~/code/tomodachi$ pip install -U .[uvloop,protobuf,aiodns,opentelemetry]

# Verify that the tomodachi CLI is installed
local ~/code/tomodachi$ tomodachi --version
local ~/code/tomodachi$ python -m tomodachi --version

# Finally to start services
local ~/code/tomodachi$ tomodachi run examples/basic_examples/http_simple_service.py
```

To add a PR, for the repository, commit your changes to your own clone
and make a PR on GitHub for your clone against master branch.

### Automated linting, unit tests and integration tests

There are GitHub actions enabled on "push" to automate test cases for
the most common use-cases, as well as performing lint tests, type hint
checking, etc. You can also run them on your own, see `Makefile` for a
helping hand.

Note that the code must conform to the `black` code style and imports
must be sorted alphabetically, and automatically separated into sections
and by type. ðŸ–¤

Use the following `make` commands to run these tasks on demand:

```bash
local ~/code/tomodachi$ make black
# Runs: black tomodachi/ examples/ tests/

local ~/code/tomodachi$ make isort
# Runs: isort tomodachi/ examples/ tests/
```
